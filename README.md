### Hi there 👋, I am Talha

🚀 I’m a Full Stack Data & AI Engineer with 4+ years of experience building intelligent, AI-powered web applications that bridge cloud-native systems, real-time data pipelines, and advanced machine learning. I specialize in end-to-end product development—from backend data architecture to front-end AI integration.

🧠 My expertise spans full-stack development, LLM integration, big data engineering, and MLOps. I’ve built scalable data pipelines and real-time vector search systems to power smart assistants and generative AI tools. Earlier, I led the development of industrial IoT platforms for smart manufacturing—blending edge devices with cloud dashboards using Azure IoT, NodeRed, InfluxDB, and Grafana.

🔍 My unique strength lies in connecting hardware-level sensing with modern AI interfaces—bringing intelligence from embedded systems to the user-facing web through responsive, data-driven apps.

🤖 I’m passionate about real-time edge-AI, cyber-physical systems, and autonomous platforms that make decisions from sensor data. I’m currently pursuing an MS in Data Engineering with a thesis on Edge Computing for Big Data Analytics in Autonomous Systems—advancing my mission to merge AI, robotics, and real-time intelligence into meaningful solutions.

📩 Let’s connect if you're building the next generation of AI-driven platforms, smart interfaces, or autonomous systems.
