### Hi there 👋, I am Talha

🚀 I’m a Data & AI Engineer with 4 years of experience delivering intelligent, data-driven solutions across AI, IoT, and SaaS domains blending embedded systems with cloud-native architectures to enable real-time analytics, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision-making.

🔍 I designed and developed scalable data pipelines and vector search systems for LLMs, enabling responsive, intelligent assistants. Previously I led the development of industrial IoT platforms for smart manufacturing using Azure IoT, NodeRed, InfluxDB, and Grafana, integrating sensor data into actionable insights.

🧠 My work spans R&D, full-stack development, LLM integration, and big data engineering, with a unique ability to connect hardware-level sensing with cutting-edge AI applications.

🤖 I’m passionate about autonomous systems, cyber-physical platforms, and real-time edge-AI that make intelligent decisions from sensor data. I'm currently pursuing an MS in Data Engineering, where my thesis explores Edge Computing for Big Data Analytics in Autonomous Systems aligning closely with my long-term mission: to innovate where AI meets robotics, autonomy, and real-time intelligence.

📩 Let’s connect if you're working on the next generation of AI-powered platforms, autonomous machines, or real-time decision systems.
